# AI-Powered Predictive Analytics

## Project Description
This project uses machine learning to create predictive models based on historical data. The goal is to forecast outcomes, such as customer churn or sales predictions, based on a set of features.

## Technologies Used
- Python (scikit-learn, pandas, numpy)
- Jupyter Notebooks
- Matplotlib, Seaborn (for visualization)
- SQL (for data extraction)

## Features
- Data preprocessing and feature engineering.
- Model training using various machine learning algorithms (Linear Regression, Random Forest, etc.).
- Evaluation of model performance using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
- Visualization of data and model results.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.x
- Jupyter Notebook
- pip (Python package installer)

### Installation
1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/ai-predictive-analytics.git
    cd ai-predictive-analytics
    ```

2. Install dependencies:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

### Usage
1. Open the Jupyter Notebook:
    ```bash
    jupyter notebook
    ```

2. Run the cells in the notebook to load the data, train models, and view the results.
